# Depressive Tweet Detection on Twitter dataset

### ABSTRACT: 
Depression is one of the most prevalent health conditions around the globe. It has been
predicted that by the age of 65, one in three women and one in five men could experience a severe
depressive episode. Studies indicate there is correlation between depression and increased usage of
social media. The ubiquity of social media in human lives presents us with a rich dataset which can
also be utilized for medical purposes. So, for this project we are using the tweets data from Twitter.
We shall be extracting two types of tweets: random and depressive using Twitter APIs. The next stage
would be data preparation, followed by feature extraction and then classification using python
libraries. We will build two classifiers using Na√Øve Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms
and compare the accuracy for the same. The ML model which is more accurate will be used for
predicting whether a given tweet is depressive or not. An extended application of this project can (be
used) to come up with an architecture that limits diffusion of depressive tweets into social media.

### DATASETS:
* Number of records: 24000 (tweets)
* Number of columns (fields/ features): tweets, class of tweet (0: random tweet, 1: depressive tweet)
* Column data types: Text, Number
